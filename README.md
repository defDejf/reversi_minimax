# Reversi bot
Created in first year college for a reversi (othello) competition. Uses mini-max with aplha-beta pruning and static gameboard heureistics. Adjusts recursion depth based on last reached depth and time limit for decision. Repository contains files for running tests provided by my university. My work is Player.py.
